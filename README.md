# Civil War Overhaul - Redux

For Skyrim Special/Anniversay Edition

This mod attempts to bring new life into the frankly bullshit Civil War questline. This mod is based off of the original Civil War Overhaul written by apollodown. I have gone and rebuilt the mod from the ground up, hopefully adding a lot of support and stability in addition to many enhancements to deliver an improved experience but also sticking to the vision of the original mod. Here are the changes:

## Before the Civil War questline
* Cities and military camps will have a small chance of containing spies. Spies will seek out an assassination target before vanishing into the night (or day...It doesn't matter they have a potion of invisiblity). Before the Civil War since you have not picked a side, you won't be selected as a target. But once you do... (Configurable in the MCM)
* Added mages to the footsoldier/archer troops all around Skyrim

## During the Civil War questline
### Things really heat up once the battle for Whiterun starts
* Troops during sieges will be much more diverse than vanilla, incorporating several flavors of warriors, spellcasters and even monsters into the fray. Troops have also been properly perked to make them the believable trained soldiers that they should be. By default, the variety is unleveled but a separate plugin is included to designate leveled troops. A separate Zedit Patcher has also been included to tailor the troops you want to see to your tastes.
* There is a small chance that dragons will also crash the party further adding to the insanity. The chance of this happening is configurable in the MCM.
* In addition to keeping yourself alive, the welfare of your troops needs to be considered. If too many troops fall, you will lose the battle. The number of troops at your disposal will be determined by radiant quest rewards, hold proximity to other Holds that you.. well.. hold and by a multiplier that you can fully administer in the MCM.
* If you die in battle, you will instead faint and be whisked off to a nearby military camp. This is configurable in the MCM. The percentage of troops left alive on either side will determine the outcome of the battle. So you can still fall but your side will still win.
* Winning the hold battle will net you unique weapons and armor exclusive to this mod that you will not find anywhere else.
### So you won (or lost) the battle for Whiterun
* The Civil War questline now opens up as a fully radiant questline. If you lost the battle for Whiterun, your side is set as the defender for a hold that you already own. If you won, you will be on the offensive and then you will be sent to the military camp in an enemy hold.
* Holds will now know what side you are on and will openly attack you while in a hold occupied by the enemy. A lightweight disguise feature is included to allow you to enter enemy cities without trouble. This feature is configurable in the MCM.
* Once a hold is selected, I make use of the powerful but ultimately unused CWCampaign to act as a quest manager. This quest manager keeps track of campaign "phases" which are the number of missions that will happen before a City Siege. In the MCM, you can control how many radiant missions will be assigned before being ordered to attack or defend the hold's city. The default number of missions between city sieges can be set to 4, 2 or none for offense, or 2, 1, or none for defense.
* If you on are the defensive, you will receive the missions prior to the city defense via the Courier. He will show up after a few days so its best to just to play around as normal until he shows up (the time to wait before he shows up is configurable in the MCM but we all know that the Courier is pretty problematic so don't bother waiting around for him). The radiant quests consist of defending the fort or a garrison within the hold. Successfully defending the fort and or garrison will give you bonuses to the number of troops in the city siege defense.
* If on the offensive, you be given missions 2 at a time by your commanding officer (unless you selected 0 missions in the MCM to which they will just skip to ordering the attack on the city). The base game only included 4 missions whereas CWO incorporates those 4 and restores 6 additional missions cut from the base game (more details on that included here https://tcrf.net/The_Elder_Scrolls_V:_Skyrim/Civil_War). The dialogue by the commanding officers are fully voiced as it was all recorded but cut dialogue. Again, finishing the quests successfully will reward you with additional troops and even some new allies for the city siege.
* If you are on the offense but hanging around in a city that you control, there is also a small chance that there will be a squad to your doorstep intending to sack the city. This chance is configurable in the MCM (under 'Spanish Inquisition').
* In the base game, only 3 cities were elligible for Civil War sieges. Now all 9 will be up for grabs and the battle for each city will determine who will  maintain or relinquish control of the hold. Again, like Whiterun, winning the battle will put you on the offensive while losing will put you on the defensive of the next hold. 
* Markarth and Riften city proper will have additional debris and barriers set similar to Whiterun to make things a little more interesting.
* Winning the battle at minor cities will also trigger a scene with the Jarl handing over control to the player.
### So only Windhelm or Solitude remains, what next?
* Windhelm and Solitude now both will have you go through the city exterior to reach the front gate like the other major cities.
* If on the defensive, ready yourself for your final stand against the enemy. If the enemy breaks through, your side loses the war.
* If on the offensive, once you reach the city gate the Solitude/Windhelm interior sieges will play out like normal along with a final unique prize given out by your respective generals.

## After the Civil War
* The rest of the game should remain as though you completed the Civil War questline normally (but it was hopefully a lot more fun :) )

# Additional Features
* A compatibility section has been added to the MCM. Since several locations are now used as battlegrounds for the Civil War, heavily modded lists can see some issues. (particularly if you made significant changes to the exterior of Solitude and Windhelm)
* A leveled patch has been added. The original CWO was unleveled so I added a patch to level gate some of the higher level NPC's that could be added to a siege. This patch only affects 2 leveled lists and is ESL'ified so it won't take a spot in your load order. If you want to stick with the original craziness, simply untick the CWOLeveled.esp file.
