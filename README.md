# Civil War Overhaul - Redux
This mod attempts to bring new life into the frankly bullshit Civil War questline. This mod is based off of the original Civil War Overhaul written by apollodown. I have gone and rebuilt the mod from the ground up, hopefully adding a lot of support and stability in addition to many enhancements to deliver an improved experience but also sticking to the vision of the original mod. Here are the changes:

## Before the Civil War questline
* City guards will wear armor that will reflect the hold's alliance.
* Cities and military camps will have a small chance of containing spies. Spies will seek out an assassination target before vanishing into the night (or day...It doesn't matter they have a potion of invisiblity). Before the Civil War since you have not picked a side, you won't be selected as a target. But once you do... (Configurable in the MCM)
* Added mages to the footsoldier/archer troops all around Skyrim

## During the Civil War questline
### Things really heat up once the battle for Whiterun starts
* Troops during sieges will be much more diverse than vanilla, incorporating several flavors of warriors, spellcasters and even monsters into the fray. Troops have also been properly perked to make them the believable trained soldiers that they should be. By default, the variety is unleveled but a separate plugin is included to designate leveled troops. A separate Zedit Patcher has also been included to tailor the troops you want to see to your tastes.
* There is a small chance that dragons will also crash the party further adding to the insanity. The chance of this happening is configurable in the MCM.
* In addition to keeping yourself alive, the welfare of your troops needs to be considered. If too many troops fall, you will lose the battle. The number of troops at your disposal will be determined by radiant quest rewards, hold proximity to other Holds that you.. well.. hold and by a multiplier that you can fully administer in the MCM.
* If you die in battle, you will faint instead and be whisked off to a nearby military camp. This is configurable in the MCM. The percentage of troops left alive on either side will determine the outcome of the battle. So you can still fall but your side will still win.
* Winning the hold battle will net you unique weapons and armor that you will not find anywhere else.
### So you won (or lost) the battle for Whiterun
* The Civil War questline now opens up as a fully radiant questline. If you lost the battle for Whiterun, your side is set as the defender for a hold that you already own. If you won, you will be on the offensive and then you will be sent to the military camp in an enemy hold.
